# Welcome!
This is my repository to learn binary exploiting,\
craft payloads, maybe write-ups, and other stuff

Thanks to [Ajay](https://github.com/ajratnam) for being my mentor,\
and [Satya](https://github.com/CodeLanderV) for still sticking around and pushing me to grow,\
no matter the pressure or obstacles that hit us
